# LegendsMate - Open Source IDEs for Salesforce

LegendsMate is a fork of the amazing and legendary MavensMate. It's an open-source IDE for Salesforce development.

MavensMate ended support in the summer of 2017, and recommended users move to Microsoft's Visual Code -- an excellent option. For those of us who prefer our open-source tools, LegendsMate hopes to keep the flame alive.

## Original MavensMate Contributors - a million thanks.
